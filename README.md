# React + TypeScript + Vite

# How to use
To launch in browser: 
- npm i
- npm run dev

# Tools & Features
- Styled with TailwindCSS & HeadlessUI
- Latest React Router Dom utilities like loader functions, deferring (for loading purposes) and dynamic breadcrumbs generation
- Suspense with lazy loading
- Skeleton loaders used to handle long loading times for large amount of media
- Animation powered by Framer Motion
- Additional non-requested feature of Wikipedia redirect button
- Fully responsive of course

# Minor Incompatibility
- TailwindCSS not usable with Framer Motion, using regular CSS for Framer Motion instead

# Notes
- API response objects are very large, TS typing in types/general.ts is partial and not full coverage/accuracy
- Since the project is not real, .env won't be added to .gitignore
